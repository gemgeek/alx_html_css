## Headphones Project
This project involves building a fully functional and responsive web page from scratch, adhering to a designer's specifications provided via Figma. The primary goal is to replicate the design precisely using only HTML and CSS, with a strong emphasis on accessibility and responsive design principles, without the use of any external CSS frameworks or JavaScript.

## Project Overview
This web page is designed to showcase a product (headphones) with sections for "What we do...", "Our results speak for themselves", and a "Contact us" form. The implementation focuses on clean HTML structure, semantic tags, and custom CSS for styling, ensuring a pixel-perfect match to the provided Figma design.

## Design Source
The design for this webpage was created by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.

## Key Requirements
- No External CSS Frameworks: All styling must be achieved using custom CSS only. Frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, etc., are strictly forbidden.

- No JavaScript: The webpage must be fully functional and visually complete without any JavaScript. This means all interactions (like hover states) will be managed purely through CSS.

- From Scratch: The entire structure and styling must be built from the ground up.

- Pixel-Perfect Replication: The final webpage must look exactly the same as the provided designer file.

## Accessibility
- Accessibility is a core focus of this project. The following measures will be taken to ensure the webpage is usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities:

- Semantic HTML: Utilizing appropriate HTML5 semantic elements (e.g. header, nav, main, section, footer, button) for clear structure and meaning.

- ARIA Attributes: Where necessary, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes will be used to enhance the accessibility of custom interactive components or to provide additional context to screen readers.

- Keyboard Navigation: Ensuring all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard alone.

- Focus Management: Proper focus styles for interactive elements to provide visual cues for keyboard users.

- Contrast Ratios: Adhering to WCAG guidelines for color contrast to ensure text is readable against its background.

- Alt Text for Images: Providing descriptive alt attributes for all images to convey their content to users who cannot see them.

## Responsive Design
The webpage is designed to be fully responsive, adapting its layout and presentation based on the user's screen size.

- Mobile-First Approach: While not explicitly stated, a mobile-first approach will be considered for development to ensure optimal performance and user experience on smaller devices before scaling up.

- Breakpoints: The primary breakpoint for responsiveness is:

- Mobile Version: The webpage must switch to its mobile layout when the screen width is 480px or less.

- Max Content Width: The main content area of the page should have a maximum width of 1000px and be centered horizontally on larger screens.

## Interactions
Specific interaction states are defined to provide visual feedback to users:

- Links Hover/Active: When a link is hovered over or becomes active, its color should change to #FF6565.

- Button Hover/Active: When a button is hovered over or becomes active, its opacity should change to 0.9.

## Fonts Used
To ensure the webpage renders correctly as per the design, the following custom fonts are used. If these fonts are not pre-installed on your system, you may need to install them or include them via @font-face rules in your CSS.

- Source Sans Pro

- Spin Cycle OT (Please note: This might be a custom font or less commonly available; ensure you have the .ttf or .otf files to include via @font-face if necessary).
